Write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal)

1. A method that returns the sum of two integers

Casual:
Given two integers

1. Add the first value to the second value
2. Save the result of step 1 as the sum
3. Return the sum

Formal:
START

# Given two integers called "number1" and "number2"

SET result = number1 + number2

PRINT result

END


2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
Casual:
Given a collection of strings

1. Iterate through the collection one by one
    1.1 Save the first value as the starting value
    1.2 On each iteration, reassign the saved value to itself plus the current value.

2. After the iteration, return the saved value.

Formal:
START

# Given a collection of strings called "strings"

SET iterator = 1
SET saved_string = value within strings collection at space 1

WHILE iterator < length of strings
  saved_string = saved_string + value within strings collection at space "iterator"

  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT saved_string

END


3. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
Casual:
Given a collection of integers

1. Iterate through the collection one by one
    1.1 Save the first value to a new array
    1.2 If the current value's position in the collection is divisible by 2
        1.2.1 Skip to the next iteration
    1.3 Otherwise,
        1.3.1 Place the current value to the new array
2. After the iteration, return the new array

Formal:
START

# Given a collection of integers called "numbers"

SET iterator = 1
SET new_array = value within numbers collection at space 1

WHILE iterator < length of numbers
  IF current value / 2 = a whole number
    go to the next iteration
  ELSE
    append current value to new_array

  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT new_array
END

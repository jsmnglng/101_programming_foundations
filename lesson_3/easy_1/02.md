Describe the difference between `!` and `?` in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1. what is `!=` and where should you use it?

2. put `!` before something, like `!user_name`

3. put `!` after something, like `words.uniq!`

4. put `?` before something

5. put `?` after something

6. put `!!` before something, like `!!user_name`

* `!=` means "not equal"

* `!<some object>`is to turn any object to its opposite of their boolean equivalent

* `<method>!` is a syntax in Ruby. Most of the methods that have `!` after them means they mutate their caller but not ALL. Also, you could use it when defining your own method to indicate that your method modifies the argument being passed in.

* `?<some object>` is a Ruby syntax for ternary operator => `? :`

* `<method>?` is also a method's syntax in Ruby. Most of the methods that have `?` after them means they evaluate to boolean values but not ALL. Also, you could use it when defining your own method to indicate that your method returns a boolean value.

* put `!!<some object>` before something is to turn back any object to its boolean equivalent
